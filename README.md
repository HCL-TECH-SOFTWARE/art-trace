# art-trace

Utilities for parsing, analyzing and translating .art-trace files. Such files can be generated by realtime applications developed with [Code RealTime](https://secure-dev-ops.github.io/code-realtime/) or [Model RealTime](https://model-realtime.hcldoc.com/help/topic/com.ibm.xtools.rsarte.webdoc/users-guide/overview.html?cp=23_0).

Refer to the [samples](samples) for how to use the Trace parser. If you add this folder as a workspace folder in Visual Studio Code you can directly run the launch configurations that are present there.

## [js-sequence-diagrams](samples/jsSequenceDiagrams.ts)
Translate an .art-trace file into the sequence diagram format used by the [js-sequence-diagrams](https://bramp.github.io/js-sequence-diagrams/) web service. This sample also shows how you can access information about the trace configuration that appears inside comments at the beginning of an .art-trace file.

## [plantUML](samples/plantUML.ts)
Translate an .art-trace file into the sequence diagram format used by [plantUML](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml).

## [messageHandlingPerformance](samples/messageHandlingPerformance.ts)
Report those messages that took the longest to handle. This analysis requires a trace file with both the `time2_receive` and the `time3_handle` timestamps present. The time it took to handle a message is the difference between these two timestamps.

## [sortOnReceiveTime](samples/sortOnReceiveTime.ts)
Read a trace file and sort the messages it contains according to the `time2_receive` timestamp. This often makes the trace more natural to read and visualize, than its default sorting which is based on the `time3_handle` timestamp (whether present or not). This sample uses the `TraceSorter` utility to sort the messages. The sample uses a command-line argument for specifying the input trace file and writes the sorted trace to an output file.

## [googleTraceEventFormat](samples/googleTraceEventFormat.ts)
Translate an .art-trace file into the [Google Trace Event format](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CvAClvFfyA5R-PhYUmn5OOQtYMH4h6I0nSsKchNAySU). Currently this sample only generates B and E duration events.
